CodeCademy Off-Platform Project: Tea Cozy

# CodeCademy Project Description: 
In this project, you will create a fictional tea shop website on your own computer.

We will provide a design spec and image assets to help you along the way. A design spec is an image of a web page outlined with all of its CSS properties and values. These are usually created by a designer as a source of instructions for a web developer. This project assumes that you will be able to reproduce the basic HTML and CSS with little guidance.

# What I Hope to Gain from this Project:
I hope to greatly improve my knowledge of flexboxes in CSS and how to utilize all their different functions. Starting this project, I have minimal knowledge on using flexboxes, but want to learn as much as possible because they are very useful in coding. Another aspect I hope to improve on is my knowledge and application of HTML & CSS.
